```
    npm v5.6.0

```
## Installation
To run this project you will need to clone it onto your local machine and install all dependencies.

Navigate to you chosen directory and run the following command in the commandline to clone the package:
```
    git clone https://github.com/stephen-mckeown/airQuality.git
```

To install all dependency run:
```

Once the build process has finished the app will run locally on your machine.


## Still to do...
There is a few unfinished items within the app:
* Mobile responsive could be better with additional breakpoints and fonts units changed.
* No error handling is being completed and therefore relaying on the API to be robust.
